Welcome to Spendbird! The mediocre choice for tracking your personal spending habits.

You should be logged in safely and securely by this point (you are aren't you?).

This application has four main sections:
1) Set budget, which is displayed on the homepage.
-You can only set one budget at a time.
-The input for your new budget will be auto-filled with your existing budget.

2) Transactions
- This is the central aspect of the application.
- Here you can view a reverse-chronological list of all your stored transactions.
- You can use the drop-downs to restrict the view to transactions from a particular month, merchant, or purchase tag.
- You cannot use more than one of these filters at a time, because the developer just wasn't that good.
- For further details on a transaction, click the 'Detailed View' link accompanying it.
- This is also where you will find the options to delete or edit a transaction.
- Adding a new transaction is restricted to existing Merchants and Tags.
- This is to prevent your transaction list becoming overly disorganised.

3) Merchants
- Here you can view a list of all the Merchants you have saved.
- As with transactions, you can edit or delete them individually.

4) Tags
- These are used to 'tag' your transactions so you can see at a glance what kind of purchase it was.
- Again, you can edit or delete them individually.

To Do List:
- Change the budget to a monthly rolling budget.
- Give feedback on how well the budget was kept each month.
- Change homepage budget to only refer to the current month.
- Stack filters.
- More CSS! Make it pretty!
